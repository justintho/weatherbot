# Discord Weather Bot

Overview: This project was a Weather Bot for Discord, which was created using Python. This project makes use of the OpenWeatherMap API as a means of gathering the data for a specified city's weather. It also uses both the requests and Discord libraries of Python to help ease the development process. Once the bot is added to a Discord server, user's can ask it for the weather of a certain city either publicly or privately by typing "weather city_name" or "?weather city_name" respectively (city_name should be replaced with the name of the actual city).

Prerequisites: Before running the program, one must provide their Discord Bot token/key and OpenWeatherMap API key to the respective locations in the "bot.py" and "responses.py" files.
